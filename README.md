Part 1: Controller Hub and Learning Switch:

Discusses the differences in latency between a Hub Controller and a Learning Switch.

Explains that the Hub Controller, being part of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), incurs additional latency due to centralized control and policy management.

Contrasts this with the Learning Switch, which minimizes latency by dynamically updating its MAC address table to efficiently forward traffic.

Part 2: Firewall and Monitor:

Describes the objective of restricting communication between specific hosts using a firewall.

Outlines measures to ensure the effectiveness of real-time firewall policies, such as assigning priority levels to rules, defining rule evaluation order, and implementing conflict detection and resolution mechanisms.

Emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and auditing of rule changes for maintaining network security.


Part 3: Load Balancer:

Proposes implementing a load balancing policy that accounts for server loads by introducing dynamic monitoring of server performance.


Explains how this approach optimizes resource utilization by directing incoming traffic to servers with lower loads, thereby enhancing user experience.
